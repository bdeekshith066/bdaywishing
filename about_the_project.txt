Deekshith B - The Birthday Boi
Pranav - The person who is wishing Deekshith 
Gireesh - The developer


Pranav who wishes to wish Deekshith on his bday opens eg - bdaywishing.com  webiste created by Gireesh (a react application which takes all the details 
entered by pranav about deekshith , and gives pranav a streamlit deployed website as an output - eg - dixitbbday.streamlit.app).


Now reg the 3 themes which we are offering
1) for couples
2) for  friends
3) for wishing family members

The major difference  among the 3 is 
1)the lottie animations(eg for theme 1 we have love birds animation , for theme 2 {yet to do but something like a cake cutting animation}) ,
2)change in falling emoji , 
3)change in font colour . (arya has suggested some changes working on it)
So we have to design in such a way that
which ever theme he/she  chooses based on that the json file from the assests folder has to be assigned... through  function calls...


now pranav opened the website. He selects theme 2 , upon selecting theme 2 it lands to the next page where in he has to enter all the details about Deekshith , 
asked in the form and upon clicking final submit button the repo in  name of deekshith gets created
we have to come up with an algo for repo name creation....to make sure that the repo names dont get clashed

just to keep the user engaging we can ask him to click one more button for deploymenet and meanwhile show him some aniamtions of the process is almost getting done...



every repo will contain

assests folder 
images folder 
main.py
home.py
chatbot.py
wishes.py




In the basic_form folder which i have uploaded , it contains a html form which takes in user  input of name and nickname and upon clicking submit button 
 a repo gets created in name entered by pranav and the repo contains assests folder and main.py , home.py ,wishes.py , chatbot.py{all these have the static code }





Wishes.py
For this page the required inputs from the user(pranav) is 
The number of people who are wishing deekshith  (pranav would have contacted deekshith's friends and would have asked for a bday wish msg 
 of them wishing deekshith, and a pic of theirs with Deekshith)

so in the form need to ask for number of people , and then that many number of inputs
friend 1 name - 
frined 1 wish - 
friend 1 image with deekshith - 

frined 2 name - 
friend 2 wish - 
friend 2 image with deekshith - 

for all the themes same animations for this page 
assests/box_open.json  
assests/letter_open.json




Chatbot.py
For this page the developer(gireesh) would provide the user(pranav) with already  4 set of questions on - 
1)a question which revolves around when did they meet 
2) their most memorable moment
3) their saddest point any sorrows...
4) their future

now if pranav wishes to edit any of the question he can do so by clicking on the edit button in the right below each question in the form

Here the required inputs from the user are
. The questions -  user can change or  go with the set of question given by the developer
. next right below each question their should be input for the answer  and below it keyword for the answer
(need to tell pranav when deekshith enters (eg for question 1) date he will get the answer as the response)
also need to ask for hint(that also user can edit or go witht he one given by developer)


the key only differnce among the 3 themes is that questions slightly change ,font colout of  heading and sub para colourchanges
 rest all (chatbot input box , chatbot response .... )
